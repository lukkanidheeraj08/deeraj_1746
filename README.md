## **Client Management System in C (Using Structures & Functions)**

---

# **📌 Abstract**

This project is a simple **Client Management System** written in the C programming language. It demonstrates how to use **structures, arrays, and user-defined functions** to store and manage client information without using advanced libraries. The system allows the user to:

* Add new clients
* View all clients
* Search clients by ID
* Exit the program

It uses a global array of structures to store up to 10 clients, with each client containing an ID, name, and account balance. The goal of the project is to provide a beginner-friendly demonstration of handling structured data and building menu-driven console applications in C.
